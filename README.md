# MultiStepForm Generator - FormulateFlow

Ever wrestle with clunky multi-step forms in React? ‚Äç

I know I did. That's why I built this open-source project: to streamline the process and make creating multi-step forms in React applications a breeze.

I have fine-tuned an OpenAI assistant to understand the specific needs of multi-step forms within this tech stack. Need to quickly build a form structure? The assistant can help you generate the code using your desired libraries!

## Tech Stack

- **React Hook Form Integration**: Utilize the power of React Hook Form for handling form states and validations.
- **Zustand for State Management**: Manage global state across different form steps effortlessly with Zustand.
- **Dynamic Form Schema**: Define your form structure and validation using Zod.
- **Styling with Shadcn**: Ensure your forms are not only functional but also visually appealing with Shadcn.
